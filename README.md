# Awesome zero-knowledge rollups
>[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
> A list of awesome resources to learn about, build on and deeply understand zero-knowledge/validity rollups

## Why this list?
There are a lot of resources on zero-knowledge cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, most notably the [awesome zero-knowledge proofs repository](https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs) by Matter Labs. However, there are no resources dedicated to understanding zero-knowledge or validity **rollups** - i.e. approaching them from the perspective of cryptoeconomics, distributed consensus and system security rather than only from a cryptography POV. This repository is an attempt to make this journey a bit easier by compiling high-quality resources - blog posts, tutorials, research papers - into a single place so that everyone can truly understand zk-rollups from a holistic lens.

## Types of rollups - overview and differences

[Optimistic and Validity Rollups: Analysis and Comparison between Optimism and StarkNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16610) by [Luca Donnoh](https://github.com/lucadonnoh) - a good primer on how optimistic and zk-rollups differ fundamentally
